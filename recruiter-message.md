## Subject: Senior Software Engineer - Innovative Resume Presentation

---

Dear [Recruiter Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to express my interest in senior software engineering opportunities and would like to share my professional background with you in an innovative way.

As a Senior Software Engineer with 13+ years of experience specializing in cloud-native development, microservices architecture, and high-performance financial systems, I'm always exploring new ways to demonstrate technical capabilities and professional growth.

**You can access my complete resume and professional portfolio in the `contact/` folder of this repository:**
👉 **[Repository Link: github.com/thiago2santos/wallet-service](https://github.com/thiago2santos/wallet-service)**

I'm presenting my resume this way as an **experimental approach** to showcase not just my professional experience, but also my commitment to:
- **Innovation in professional presentation**
- **Technical proficiency** through real, production-ready code
- **Modern development practices** and architectural patterns
- **Transparency** in demonstrating actual technical capabilities

This repository contains a complete digital wallet microservice I've architected, featuring:
- ⚡ Sub-20ms response times with 1000+ RPS capacity
- 🏗️ CQRS and Event Sourcing architecture with Apache Kafka
- 🔧 Comprehensive quality gates (95% mutation test coverage)
- 📊 Enterprise-grade monitoring and observability
- ☁️ Cloud-native design with resilience patterns

I believe this approach provides a more comprehensive view of my technical skills and professional capabilities than a traditional resume alone.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in building high-performance financial systems, leading international teams, and implementing modern architectural patterns could contribute to your clients' technical objectives.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

**Thiago dos Santos**
