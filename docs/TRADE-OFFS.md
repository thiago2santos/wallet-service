# ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs and Compromises

> Honest assessment of compromises made due to time constraints and practical considerations
> **Updated**: Reflects all implementations completed since initial assessment

## üéØ Time Investment

**Total Time Invested**: ~40+ hours (significantly exceeded initial 6-8 hour guideline)

**Time Breakdown**:
- Architecture & Setup: 4 hours
- Core Implementation: 8 hours  
- Testing & Validation: 8 hours
- Infrastructure & AWS: 12 hours
- Performance Testing: 6 hours
- Documentation: 4 hours

**Rationale for Extended Investment**: What started as a simple assessment evolved into a comprehensive production-ready system with enterprise-grade features.

## üö® Key Compromises Made

### 1. Security Implementation

**What Was Simplified**:
- ‚ùå No authentication/authorization implemented
- ‚ùå No rate limiting at application level
- ‚ùå No HTTPS enforcement
- ‚ùå No API key management

**Rationale**:
- **Time Constraint**: Security is complex and time-consuming
- **Production Strategy**: Planned to use AWS API Gateway + WAF for enterprise security
- **Focus**: Prioritized core business logic over security infrastructure

**Production Plan**:
```yaml
AWS API Gateway:
  - Authentication (JWT, API Keys)
  - Rate limiting (100 req/min per user)
  - DDoS protection
  - HTTPS termination
  
AWS WAF:
  - SQL injection protection
  - XSS protection  
  - IP whitelisting/blacklisting
```

### 2. Advanced Monitoring

**What Was Fully Implemented**:
- ‚úÖ **5 Comprehensive Grafana Dashboards**:
  - Golden Metrics (SRE) Dashboard with SLI/SLO monitoring
  - Business Metrics Dashboard (money flow, operations)
  - Technical Metrics Dashboard (CQRS, outbox pattern)
  - Infrastructure Metrics Dashboard (JVM, DB pools)
  - Service Overview Dashboard (high-level health)
- ‚úÖ **Custom Prometheus Metrics** (30+ business and technical metrics)
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Health Checks** for all dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Performance Baseline Testing** with automated monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Monitoring Tools** for load testing

**What Was Simplified**:
- ‚ùå No alerting rules configured (dashboards ready for alerts)
- ‚ùå No distributed tracing (single service architecture)
- ‚ùå No centralized log aggregation (local development focus)

**Rationale**:
- **Complete Observability**: Implemented comprehensive monitoring stack
- **SRE Best Practices**: Golden Metrics dashboard follows industry standards
- **Production Ready**: Full monitoring infrastructure with auto-provisioning

### 3. Multi-Currency Support

**What Was Simplified**:
- ‚ùå Only BRL (Brazilian Real) supported
- ‚ùå No currency conversion
- ‚ùå No exchange rate management

**Rationale**:
- **Complexity**: Currency handling adds significant complexity
- **Time Focus**: Better to do single currency well than multiple currencies poorly
- **Future Extension**: Architecture supports adding currencies later

**Implementation Impact**:
```java
// Current: Simple and focused
public class Money {
    private BigDecimal amount; // Always BRL
}

// Future: Multi-currency ready
public class Money {
    private BigDecimal amount;
    private Currency currency;
}
```

@Retry(name = "optimistic-lock", maxAttempts = 5, delay = 100)
@Timeout(5000)
public Uni<Wallet> persistWallet(Wallet wallet) { ... }
```

**What Was Simplified**:
- ‚ùå No bulkhead patterns for resource isolation
