# Security & Compliance

## Overview

The Wallet Service implements comprehensive security measures to protect financial transactions and user data, following industry best practices and regulatory requirements.

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Authentication
- RS256 algorithm for signature
- Short-lived tokens (1 hour)
- Refresh token rotation
- Token revocation support

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```json
{
  "roles": {
    "user": {
      "permissions": [
        "wallet:read",
        "wallet:deposit",
        "wallet:withdraw",
        "wallet:transfer"
      ]
    },
    "admin": {
      "permissions": [
        "wallet:read",
        "wallet:write",
        "wallet:freeze",
        "wallet:close",
        "system:metrics"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### OAuth2 Integration
- Support for multiple identity providers
- OpenID Connect compliance
- Scope-based authorization
- MFA enforcement

## Data Protection

### Encryption at Rest
- AWS KMS for key management
- Automatic key rotation
- Separate keys for different environments
- Field-level encryption for PII

### Encryption in Transit
- TLS 1.3 enforcement
- Perfect forward secrecy
- Strong cipher suites
- Certificate pinning

### Sensitive Data Handling
```json
{
  "sensitive_fields": {
    "user": [
      "tax_id",
      "phone_number",
      "email"
    ],
    "wallet": [
      "balance",
      "transaction_history"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Network Security

### VPC Configuration
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Public Subnet"
        ALB[Application Load Balancer]
        WAF[AWS WAF]
    end

    subgraph "Private Subnet"
        APP[Application Servers]
        CACHE[Redis]
    end

    subgraph "Database Subnet"
        DB[Aurora]
        DDB[DynamoDB Endpoint]
    end

    WAF --> ALB
    ALB --> APP
    APP --> CACHE
    APP --> DB
    APP --> DDB
```

### Security Groups
```json
{
  "alb_sg": {
    "inbound": ["HTTPS"],
    "outbound": ["Application"]
  },
  "application_sg": {
    "inbound": ["ALB"],
    "outbound": ["Redis", "Aurora", "DynamoDB"]
  },
  "database_sg": {
    "inbound": ["Application"],
    "outbound": []
  }
}
```

## API Security

### Request Validation

- CloudWatch Logs
- CloudTrail

### Alerting Rules
```json
{
  "high_priority": {
    "failed_login_attempts": "threshold > 5 in 5 minutes",
    "large_transactions": "amount > $10,000",
    "suspicious_ip": "multiple accounts accessed"
  },
  "medium_priority": {
    "rate_limit_exceeded": "threshold > 100 in 1 minute",
    "failed_transactions": "threshold > 10 in 1 hour"
  }
}
```
