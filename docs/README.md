  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "user123", "currency": "USD"}'

# Deposit funds
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/wallets/{walletId}/deposit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 100.00, "referenceId": "dep123"}'

# Check balance
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/wallets/{walletId}/balance
```

### 🏆 Production Benefits

- **🛡️ Triple-layer security** - WAF, API Gateway, EKS network policies
- **⚡ Auto-scaling** - From 3 to 100+ pods based on demand
- **🔄 High availability** - Multi-AZ deployment with 99.99% uptime
- **📊 Full observability** - CloudWatch, X-Ray, custom metrics
- **💰 Cost optimized** - Serverless Aurora, spot instances

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### **💡 Why These Choices?**

#### **🔄 CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
**Decision**: Separate read and write operations  
**Rationale**: Financial systems need optimized reads (balance queries) and writes (transactions). CQRS allows independent scaling and different data models for each.

#### **📝 Event Sourcing with Kafka**
**Decision**: Store all changes as immutable events  
**Rationale**: Financial regulations require complete audit trails. Event sourcing provides natural auditing, time-travel queries, and system rebuilding capabilities.

#### **🗄️ Aurora MySQL over RDS**
**Decision**: Aurora Serverless v2 with Global Database  
**Rationale**: Financial services need 99.99% availability. Aurora provides automatic failover, cross-region replication, and scales from 0.5 to 128 ACUs based on demand.

#### **⚡ Redis Caching Strategy**
**Decision**: ElastiCache Redis for wallet state caching  
**Rationale**: Balance queries are frequent and latency-sensitive. Redis reduces database load and provides sub-10ms response times for cached data.

#### **🏗️ Quarkus over Spring Boot**
**Decision**: Quarkus framework with native compilation  
**Rationale**: Lower memory footprint (50MB vs 200MB+), faster startup (0.5s vs 3s+), and better Kubernetes resource utilization for cost optimization.

#### **🔄 Reactive Programming (Mutiny)**
**Decision**: Non-blocking I/O throughout the stack  
**Rationale**: Financial systems handle high concurrency. Reactive programming maximizes throughput with fewer threads, reducing resource consumption.

#### **🛡️ Resilience Patterns**
**Decision**: Circuit breakers, retries, and graceful degradation  
**Rationale**: Financial systems cannot afford downtime. Multiple layers of protection ensure service availability even during partial system failures.

### **⚖️ Trade-offs Made**

#### **Complexity vs Reliability**
- **Trade-off**: Increased system complexity for higher reliability
- **Justification**: Financial services prioritize availability and data consistency over simplicity

#### **Consistency vs Performance**  
- **Trade-off**: Eventual consistency for events vs immediate consistency for balances
- **Justification**: Balance operations need strong consistency, but audit events can be eventually consistent

#### **Cost vs Performance**
- **Trade-off**: Higher infrastructure costs for better performance and availability
- **Justification**: Financial services require enterprise-grade SLAs, justifying premium AWS services

## 🛡️ Enterprise-Grade Resilience

> **Built for the real world** - When systems fail (and they will), our wallet service keeps running.

**Zero downtime. Zero data loss. Maximum availability.**

#### **⚡ Intelligent Failure Protection**

**🔄 Circuit Breakers** - Prevent cascade failures across all dependencies
- **Database failures** → Automatic read-only mode
- **Cache outages** → Direct database fallback  
- **Event system down** → Guaranteed event preservation

**🎯 Result**: System stays online even when critical components fail

#### **🔄 Smart Recovery Strategies**

**🔁 Intelligent Retries** - Never give up on critical financial operations
- **Concurrent transactions** → Automatic retry with optimistic locking
- **Network hiccups** → Smart backoff and recovery
- **Event publishing** → Guaranteed delivery with outbox pattern

**🎯 Result**: Transient failures become invisible to users

#### **🎯 Graceful Degradation**

**📉 Smart Fallbacks** - When things go wrong, we adapt instead of failing

| **When This Fails** | **We Do This** | **User Sees** |
|---------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **🔴 Database** | Switch to read-only mode | Balance queries work, transactions paused |
| **🔴 Cache** | Direct database queries | Slightly slower responses |
| **🔴 Events** | Queue for later processing | All operations work, audit delayed |
| **🔴 Multiple systems** | Prioritize core functions | Essential features always available |

**🎯 Result**: Users experience minimal disruption even during major outages

**🏥 Real-Time Health Monitoring** - Always know your system status
- **Health Score**: 0-100 based on active degradations
- **Impact Assessment**: Clear understanding of user impact
- **Automatic Recovery**: System returns to normal when issues resolve

### 🏆 **The Bottom Line**

**Your wallet service is built like a fortress:**
- **🛡️ Triple-layer protection** against failures
- **⚡ Automatic recovery** from outages  
- **📊 Real-time monitoring** of system health
- **🎯 Zero data loss** guarantee

**Ready for production. Ready for scale. Ready for the real world.**
